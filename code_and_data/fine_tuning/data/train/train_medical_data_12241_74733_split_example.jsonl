Having headaches, muscle aches, stomachaches, or unexplained pains. Difficulty controlling feelings of worry. Having sleep problems, such as difficulty falling or staying asleep", "Panic disorder.

Feelings of impending doom. Feelings of being out of control. People with panic disorder often worry about when the next attack will happen and actively try to prevent future attacks by avoiding places, situations, or behaviors they associate with panic attacks.
