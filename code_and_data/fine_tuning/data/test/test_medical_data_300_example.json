Aging and age-related changes in the spine happen over a period of time and slowly cause loss of the normal structure of the spine. They are the most common causes of spinal stenosis. As people age, the ligaments that keep the vertebrae of the spine in place may thicken and calcify (harden from deposits of calcium salts). Bones and joints may also enlarge. When surfaces of the bone begin to project out from the body, these projections are called osteophytes (bone spurs). For example: A herniated (bulging) disk may place pressure on the spinal cord or nerve root. Disks are cushion-like pads that lie between the vertebrae and act like shock absorbers and spacers for the spine. As the disk ages, it can dry out and crack, causing the disk to bulge. When a segment of the spine becomes too mobile, the capsules (membranes) of the facet joints at the back of the vertebrae thicken. This effort to try to stabilize the segment can cause bone spurs, which decrease the space around the nerve roots leaving the spinal cord. Spondylolisthesis happens when one vertebra slips forward on another vertebra. This creates poor alignment of the spinal column and can place pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots."

Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease in which the tissues in the joint break down over time. It is the most common type of arthritis and is more common in older people. Osteoarthritis can lead to disk degeneration and an enlargement or overgrowth of bone that narrows the central and nerve root canals, causing spinal stenosis. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic (long-lasting) inflammatory disease that mostly affects joints. RA causes pain, swelling, stiffness, and loss of function in joints. It is an autoimmune disorder because the immune system attacks the healthy joint tissues.  Although not a common cause of spinal stenosis, damage from RA can cause significant problems with joints in the spine, leading to spinal stenosis."

            "candidate_scope": "ECT: How it works. Before a doctor performs ECT, the patient is sedated with a short-acting general anesthetic and given an intravenous muscle relaxant to prevent movement. During the procedure: Electrodes are placed at precise locations on the patient’s head. An electric current is sent through the electrodes into the brain, causing seizure activity that lasts under a minute. Anesthesia ensures the patient does not experience pain or feel the electrical pulses. Often, a blood pressure cuff is used on an arm or leg to block the muscle relaxant and allow movement of that limb to confirm the seizure activity is adequate. The patient wakes up 5–10 minutes after the procedure ends. They may feel groggy at first as the anesthesia wears off, but after about an hour, they are usually alert and can resume normal activities. A typical course of ECT is administered three times a week until a patient's symptoms improve (usually within 6–12 treatments). Frequently, a patient who undergoes ECT also takes antidepressant or mood-stabilizing medication. Although ECT is effective in treating depressive episodes, follow-up treatment—either antidepressant medication or maintenance ECT —is usually required to sustain the clinical improvement and reduce the chances that symptoms return. Maintenance ECT varies depending on the patient’s needs and may range from one session per week to one session every few months."

Your eye doctor can inject a medicine called Botox into your eyelid muscles to make them stop twitching. Most people need to get injections every 3 to 4 months.  Surgery. If injections don’t work for you, your doctor may recommend a surgery called myectomy. In a myectomy, a surgeon will remove some of the muscle or nerve tissue from your eyelids to help stop the twitching."

Type I collagen is a material in bones that helps make them strong. The defect in the genes causes the body to make collagen incorrectly or not make enough, leading to weak bones that break more easily. There is no way to prevent the disease. Type I collagen is also in other connective tissues such as tendon, ligament, lung, and skin, and these tissues can sometimes be affected."
